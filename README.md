# XR First Aid Training Prototype

The project is a WebXR-based training prototype that provides VR/AR users with actual first aid educational experiences. The prototype develops an interactive simulation that uses Babylon.js and Babylon.js GUI to model a 3D dummy representing a CPR training dummy.

## Features
Immersive XR Experience: 
The application delivers VR and AR experiences through WebXR standards and supports various devices.
3D Dummy Model:  
The system incorporates the "Receiving CPR" 3D model, which creates virtual first aid simulation environments (such as performing CPR).
Step-by-Step Instructions: 
 Users can follow CPR directions due to the training steps placed over the visual scene.
Responsive UI: 
 The interface elements stay visible across both desktop inline mode and immersive VR mode operations.

## Challenges and Future Work
Creating this immersive XR CPR training prototype required the resolution of multiple difficulties. The main challenge involved keeping the instructional steps visible during immersive VR operation while reallocating camera control and adjusting the layer display orders for user interface elements. The development team faced two major obstacles, including testing the system across various devices and ensuring secure HTTPS connections.

The upcoming enhancements for interactivity in this design will incorporate CPR animations coupled with haptic effects and audio signaling for creating a realistic training simulation.
